# Freedom for content producers

Free software tools and services for building static websites with **steroids**.

{{< tip "warning" >}}
Content producers become hostage to platforms like Medium that hide commercial interests behind a discourse of information democratization, indiscriminately processing data from producers and readers for this purpose.
{{< /tip >}}

{{< tip "warning" >}}
Producers who don't submit to mainstream platforms are forced to build and maintain their own channels.
{{< /tip >}}

{{< tip "warning" >}}
The tools available to assist in the construction of these platforms that do not process and sell user data are expensive and often make it impossible to escape from mainstream platforms.
{{< /tip >}}

{{< tip >}}
Statictask is a **non-profit** initiative to build and facilitate the use of open source tools for building static websites
