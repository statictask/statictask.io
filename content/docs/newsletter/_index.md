The simplest newsletter service for static sites.

This project aims to cover the necessity of a simple newsletter service for small and medium blogs or any service that doesn't need all the fency resources of another expensive SaaS.

The design is simple enough to be deployed by any programmer in a any infrastructure. The unique dependency is Postgres, so two containers might be enough depending on your usage.
